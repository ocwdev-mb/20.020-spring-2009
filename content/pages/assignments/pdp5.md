First, reconsider the challenges and opportunities that were presented in today's studio ({{% resource_link c4615bc8-0f9d-6af0-20f6-0ca89935fe60 "Week #3" "#Studio_3:_Sorting_Hat_into_Project_Camps" %}}).

Then select your 3 favorite project ideas as well as your first and second choice for a camp assignment to your counselors. Next week, you'll be assigned a team and, as a team, you'll get started on 3 ideas in your area of interest.
